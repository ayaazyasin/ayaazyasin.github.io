<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at the University of Cincinnati working with the <a href="https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/lab-for-interfacial-dynamics.html" target="_blank">UC Lab for Interfacial Dynamics</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/bellurkn" target="_blank">Dr. Kishan Bellur</a>. Broadly my research is focused on modeling liquid-vapor phase change and related interfacial phenomena. Other research interests include computational fluid dynamics for multiphase flows, scientific computing, and fluid mechanics in microgravity. My current research is focused on understanding oscillations in thin liquid films and the role that phase change plays in their dynamics and stability. 

During my graduate career, I have worked as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/uc-simulation-center.html" target="_blank">P&G Digital Accelerator at UC</a> studying methods to optimize algorithms for bounding box calculations. I have also taught two undergraduate courses as the instructor of record, teaching 300 first year students in the College of Engineering and Applied Science.

Prior to my PhD, I earned my Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering and my Bachelor of Science in Mechnical Engineering Technology from the University of Cincinnati, which included five semesters of co-op experiences, exposing me to a variety of industry positions.
