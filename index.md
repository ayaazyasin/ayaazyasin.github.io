<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at the University of Cincinnati working with the <a href="https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/lab-for-interfacial-dynamics.html" target="_blank">UC Lab for Interfacial Dynamics</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/bellurkn" target="_blank">Dr. Kishan Bellur</a>. 

My research primarily focuses on understanding and modeling liquid-vapor phase change and related phenomena. Recently, I have worked on developing coefficient-free algorithms for modeling evaporation in Hydrogen and Methane, as well as investigating phase change-induced flow patterns and surface instabilities observed in ISS experiments. My current research attempts to understand the role of phase change in the stability and dynamics of moving contact lines.


During my graduate career, I have worked as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/uc-simulation-center.html" target="_blank">P&G Digital Accelerator at UC</a> studying methods to optimize algorithms for bounding box calculations. I have also taught two undergraduate courses as the instructor of record, teaching 300 first-year students in the College of Engineering and Applied Science. Prior to my PhD, I earned my Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering and my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering Technology from the University of Cincinnati, which included five semesters of co-op experiences, exposing me to a variety of industry positions.
